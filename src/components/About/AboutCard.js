            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Harsh Choudhary </span>
            from <span className="purple">Kangra, India.</span>
            <br />
            I am currently pursuing my studies in the field of Cybersecurity.
            <br />
            I have a strong passion for ethical hacking, threat analysis, and building secure digital systems.
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from cybersecurity, here are a few things I love doing!
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li className="about-activity">
              <ImPointRight /> Playing strategy and puzzle games
            </li>
            <li className="about-activity">
              <ImPointRight /> Writing cybersecurity blogs and walkthroughs
            </li>
            <li className="about-activity">
              <ImPointRight /> Exploring new technologies and tools
            </li>
          </ul>

            "Securing systems isn't just a jobâ€”it's a responsibility to make the digital world safer for everyone."
